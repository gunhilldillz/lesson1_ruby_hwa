Assignment
1.
Rails: Create a new Rails application from scratch with one controller that has at least
three views. Try hard to not look at your class work, but feel free to consult Google and
the Rails documentation.
2. Ruby: Create an object to model something in the real world. Than, extend the object
with another object that is more specific. For example, create an Animal object withattributes that all animals have and then a Bird object that extends animal and has traits
specific to birds. Give examples of using each object after they have been declared
including assigning attributes and using instance methods.
